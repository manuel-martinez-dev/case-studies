# **The following repo is part an EYEO case study**

## Introduction:

**Important Notice**
*Please note that the following cases may vary depending on the candidate and in no purpose can be considered as the sole answer to the problems presented*

As part of a selection process, I was asked to complete several case studies on how to add filters using [addBlocl Plus](https://adblockplus.org/).

#### Description:

Using basic KISS rules, the development of the cases was done using .txt files, some screenshots were taken for reference.

Only two browsers were used (Chrome and Opera) by installing their respective extensions.

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?)

- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/adblock-plus/)

In order to better understand filter creation only the official documentation was used.
